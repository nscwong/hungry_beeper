#Web Interface of Hungry Beeper

##Introduction
The web interface of Hungry Beeper is meant to be accessed by individual restaurant to manager the current queue for the restaurant. They may choose to inform a customer that their table is ready, update the wait time, and approve new customers requesting to join the queue. 


### Current functions
--
+ Display restaurant info 

--
+ Display Queue - with table ready button
+ Need to add modification to wait time. Maybe Update from/to parse every 5 minutes or so.
+ decide whether to use web to update parse, or have another system to update. 

--
+ Add Customer to wait Queue via customer ID. 
+ Need to improve this so that it is a temporary queue and web jsut needs to approve. 
+ Currently is just a proof of concept that adding works. No restaurant is actually going to remember CustomerId...

--
+ Restaurant lookup to change restaurant
+ We may need to add password protection for each restaurant
